# Patterns
pattern shapes refer to specific arrangements of characters, numbers, or symbols generated by code to form recognizable visual designs. These patterns are commonly used as exercises to practice logic, control structures, and problem-solving skills.

## Rectangle
Creates a solid rectangle with specified dimensions. `(ex: for rows = 5 && cols = 16)`

```    
    ****************
    ****************
    ****************
    ****************
    ****************

```

## Hollow Rectangle
Displays only the outline of a rectangle, creating a frame-like structure. `(ex: for rows = 5 && cols = 21)`

```        
    *********************
    *                   *
    *                   *   
    *                   *
    *********************
```

## Half Pyramid
Forms a right-angled triangle that increases in width from top to bottom. `(ex: for number = 8)`

```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ******
    *******
    ********

```
## Inverted Half Pyramid
Creates a right-angled triangle that decreases in width from top to bottom. `(ex: for number = 9)`


```
    *********
    ********
    *******
    ******
    *****
    ****
    ***
    **
    *

```


## Rhombus
Generates a diamond-shaped pattern with symmetrical top and bottom halves. `(ex: for number = 3)`

```
    *
   ***
  *****
   ***
    *

```

## X Pattern
Creates an X-shaped pattern where the arms extend diagonally from center. `(ex: for number = 4)`

```

      *     *
       *   *
        * *
         *
        * *
       *   *
