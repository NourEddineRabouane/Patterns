# Patterns
pattern shapes refer to specific arrangements of characters, numbers, or symbols generated by code to form recognizable visual designs. These patterns are commonly used as exercises to practice logic, control structures, and problem-solving skills.

## Rectangle
Creates a solid rectangle with specified dimensions. `(ex: for rows = 5 && cols = 16)`

```    
    ****************
    ****************
    ****************
    ****************
    ****************

```

## Hollow Rectangle
Displays only the outline of a rectangle, creating a frame-like structure. `(ex: for rows = 5 && cols = 21)`

```        
    *********************
    *                   *
    *                   *   
    *                   *
    *********************
```

## Half Pyramid
Forms a right-angled triangle that increases in width from top to bottom. `(ex: for number = 8)`

```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
    ******
    *******
    ********

```
## Inverted Half Pyramid
Creates a right-angled triangle that decreases in width from top to bottom. `(ex: for number = 9)`


```
    *********
    ********
    *******
    ******
    *****
    ****
    ***
    **
    *

```


## Rhombus
Generates a diamond-shaped pattern with symmetrical top and bottom halves. `(ex: for number = 3)`

```
    *
   ***
  *****
   ***
    *

```

## X Pattern
Creates an X-shaped pattern where the arms extend diagonally from center. `(ex: for number = 4)`

```

      *     *
       *   *
        * *
         *
        * *
       *   *
      *     *

```

## Cube
Creates a solid cube with specific dimention. `(ex: for number = 5)`
>**note:** I want to mention that I've used yellow color to change text color in console [my code](https://github.com/NourEddineRabouane/Patterns/blob/master/Cube.java).
> I recommand checking the full list of ANSI color codes for more customization options [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/how-to-print-colored-text-in-java-console/)
